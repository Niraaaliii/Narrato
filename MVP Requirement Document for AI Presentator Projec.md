# MVP Requirement Document for AI Presentator Project

## Project Overview

Build an MVP for an AI Presentator tool that allows users to upload PowerPoint or document files, select an audience type, and then delivers an AI-driven presentation with the content customized by a Large Language Model (LLM) and converted to speech using Deepgram’s Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. The goal is to keep the MVP simple, functional, and demonstrate effective AI integration without over-complication.

## MVP Features

### 1. User Interface

- **Upload Interface**
    - Users can upload PPT (ppt, pptx) or text-based document files (e.g., docx, pdf).
- **Audience Selection**
    - User selects audience type from predefined options, e.g., Students, Executives, Technical, Layperson.
- **Presentation Playback**
    - Audio playback of the presentation with synchronized slides (basic slide display).
    - Controls to play, pause, and move between slides.


### 2. Backend Processing

#### Document and Slide Text Extraction

- Extract raw text content from uploaded PPT and document files.
- Extract slide titles and notes if available.


#### LLM-Powered Content Customization

- For each slide or content chunk, send extracted text with a prompt to an LLM API.
- Prompt example: “Rewrite this slide for a [audience type] audience, making it engaging, clear, and concise.”
- Receive customized, audience-specific text from LLM.


#### Text-to-Speech Conversion

- Convert the LLM-modified slide content to speech via Deepgram TTS API.
- Deliver audio output for playback.


### 3. Synchronization

- Basic synchronization of audio playback with slide transitions.
- Slide automatically changes when the audio for the current slide ends.

## Technical Stack (MVP)

- **Frontend:** Simple web interface (React, Vue, or plain JavaScript)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, or similar
- **APIs:**
    - Document/Text Extraction: GroupDocs.Parser or Aspose.Slides (or similar)
    - LLM API: OpenAI GPT-4o or equivalent
    - TTS API: Deepgram Text-to-Speech

***

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Presentation audio should begin within a few seconds after upload and audience selection.
- **Scalability:** Support single-user/demo scale for MVP.
- **Security:** Accept only safe file types and apply basic sanitization.
- **Usability:** Simple interface to support quick uploads, selections, and playback.

***

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced audience analysis beyond basic selection.
- Deep customization of TTS voice parameters.
- Real-time audience interaction or speech-to-text feedback.
- Advanced slide animations or embedded multimedia.
- User accounts or storage of past presentations.

***

## Deliverables

1. Upload file and audience selection interface.
2. Backend integration with document extractor, LLM for content transformation, and Deepgram TTS for speech synthesis.
3. Presentation player showing slides and playing AI-generated speech sequentially.
4. Clear documentation of setup and usage.

***

## Success Criteria

- User can upload a PPT/document file smoothly.
- User can select audience type easily.
- Slides are presented with rewritten, audience-tailored text.
- Presentation audio is generated and plays synced with slides.
- AI-powered customization is noticeable and meaningful to users.
